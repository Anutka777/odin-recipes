    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      My family loves soup and this is one of their favorites. It has lots of flavor and is fairly quick to make. It's primarily a mushroom soup but derives a lot of its flavor from other ingredients.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 cups chopped onions</li>
      <li>1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried dill weed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Saute the onions in the butter for 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and saute for 5 more minutes. Stir in the dill, paprika, soy sauce and broth. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes.

      <li>
        In a separate small bowl, whisk the milk and flour together. Pour this into the soup and stir well to blend. Cover and simmer for 15 more minutes, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, stir in the salt, ground black pepper, lemon juice, parsley and sour cream. Mix together and allow to heat through over low heat, about 3 to 5 minutes. Do not boil. Serve immediately.
