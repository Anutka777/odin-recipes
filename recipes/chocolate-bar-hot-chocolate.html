    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted to use up some full-size chocolate bars leftover from Halloween and decided to make hot chocolate out of one. The result was fabulous!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (1.55 ounce) bar milk chocolate candy bar, chopped</li>
      <li>â…” cup milk, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place chocolate pieces in a saucepan over medium-low heat; add milk and whisk constantly until chocolate is melted and well blended, about 5 minutes. Whisk in cinnamon. Remove from heat; add more milk if desired. Serve in a mug.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
